# Task Manager

A TypeScript-based task manager application with a simple and intuitive UI.

## Description

The Task Manager is a web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. It leverages TypeScript’s object-oriented programming features, including interfaces, classes, and type annotations, ensuring robust and maintainable code. The project follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern and is built using Vite for a fast and optimized development experience. The application uses HTML and CSS for the front-end and stores task list information in the browser’s localStorage. This project was motivated by the need for a straightforward and efficient task management tool that can be used directly in the browser without the need for an external database.

## Installation

Step-by-step instructions on how to get your project running on the user's local machine. Include any dependencies they need to install.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:zeekhoks/ToDo-List.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd src`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the project: `npm run dev` (if it's a Node.js project)
5. Your project should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Future Scope
Planned enhancements for the Task Manager include:

- **Advanced Filtering and Sorting**: Add features to filter and sort tasks based on priority, due date, and other criteria.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their task lists separately.
- **Data Persistence**: Integrate with a backend service to provide persistent storage beyond localStorage.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Improve the UI to be fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices
- **Notifications**: Add reminders and notifications for upcoming tasks.
